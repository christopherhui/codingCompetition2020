***THIS IS A STARRED QUESTION***

I ALLOW THE FOLLOWING TO BE SHARED:
- GROUP NAMES
- CODE

Create a simple calculator that takes in two integers and a special character string. Your goal is to obtain the WORST runtimes possible.

Your calculator MUST output the correct results and your code must be LESS THAN 50 lines of code. Your SHORTEST runtimes will be compared with other teams.

When dividing, you can assume the ceiling of the result will be outputted.

Input: integer, integer, string
Output: integer

Constraints:
-10^6 <= input integers <= 10^6
string is of: "+", "-", "*", "/"

Example1:
Input: 2,4,"/"
Output: 1

Example2:
Input: 100,1,"+"
Output: 101
==========================================
Description:
Let the first number be A, the second number be B.
Add: Multiply both numbers by 100000000 and move 1 from the larger number to the smaller number until the larger number is 0.
Subtract: Same as add, but B is multiplied by -1.
Multiply: Add A to result B times using the add function, then multiply by -1 if needed.
Divide: Subtract B from A and increment result until A <= 0.
