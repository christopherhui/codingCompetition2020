Mr. Ray's Pizzeria is running a bit low on toppings, partly due to supply chain collapse and partly due to an inexplicable increase in popular demand for pizza. Maybe people just don't like cooking?

On a particular working day at Mr. Ray's Pizzeria, he receives a number of take-out, delivery, and bake-at-home orders. Each order requires its own set of toppings, each of which Mr. Ray only has a fixed number at the start of the day.

Given the list of toppings (and their quantity) in Mr. Ray's pantry, find the maximum amount of orders he can fulfill.

<b>Input:</b> <ul> <li>The number of different toppings, <i>I</i>, and the number of orders, <i>O</i> on a single line, separated by a space.</li>
<li>A single line with <i>I</i> integers: the quantity of each topping available.
<li><i>O</i> lines each consisting of <i>I</i> integers: the number of each topping required to fill that specific order. </li>
</ul>

<b>Output:</b> The maximum number of orders which can be fulfilled.


<b>Ex.<br> In:</b>
<code>2 2<br>
1 1<br>
1 0<br>
0 1</code><br>

<b>Out:</b>
<code>2</code>


<b>In:</b>
<code>3 4<br>
2 1 3<br>
1 0 1<br>
1 1 0<br>
0 0 2<br>
0 1 1</code><br>

<b>Out: </b>
<code>3</code>

Description:
Try every possibility with backtracking, taking the max of choosing the current order and not choosing the current order at each step. Awful runtime but who gets more than 10 orders and 5 toppings anyways
