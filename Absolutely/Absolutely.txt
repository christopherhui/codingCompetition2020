Take an array of integers (positive or negative or both) and return the sum of the absolute value of each element.

"Absolute value" means to remove any negative sign in front of a number, and to think of all numbers as positive (or zero).

Input: array of integers
Output: integer

Example1:
Input: [2, -1, 4, 8, 10]

Example2:
Input: [-3, -4, -10, -2, -3]
Output: 22

Example3:
