Santa ordered pizza home. However when the courier delivered the pizza, he was very upset, because several pieces of sausage lay on the crust, and he does not really like the crust.

The pizza is a circle of radius <i>R</i> centered on the origin. Pizza consists of the main part — circle of radius <i>R - D</i> with center at the origin, and crust around the main part of the width <i>D</i>. Slices of sausage are also circles.

Santa asks you to help determine the number of pieces of sausage caught on the crust. A piece of sausage got on the crust, if it completely lies on the crust.

<b>Input:</b> <ul><li>The radius of the whole pizza <i>R</i>, the width of the crust <i>D</i>, and the number of sausage pieces on the pizza <i>N</i>, separated by spaces on a single line.</li>
<li><i>N</i> lines follow, describing each slice of sausage: where <i>x, y, r</i> describes a slice of sausage at (<i>x, y</i>) with radius <i>r</i>.</li>
</ul>

<b>Output:</b> <ul><li>A single line containing the number of sausage pieces completely lying on the crust.</li></ul>

Description:
For each sausage, do the following:
1. If the sausage is too large, ie. if (2 * sausage radius) is larger than D, the sausage cannot lie completely on the crust. In this case, skip this sausage.
2. Compute the sausage's distance to the center of the pizza (center to center).
3. Compute the shortest distance that the sausage can be to the pizza's center while still being completely on the crust (R - D + sausage radius).
4. Compute the shortest distance that the sausage can be to the pizza's center while still being completely on the crust (R - sausage radius).
5. Check that the sausage distance from #2 is within the bounds from #3 and #4. If it is, increment the count.
At the end, return the count.
